Kettlebell EMOM Builder is a training philosophy and app dedicated to helping you build sustainable strength through structured kettlebell workouts.

We believe in:
- **Structure over motivation** - Systems that work on your worst days
- **Longevity over intensity** - Training you can maintain for decades
- **Simplicity over complexity** - Clear, actionable workout plans

Our mission is to make kettlebell training accessible, systematic, and sustainable for everyone.
