I am a software developer, a dad, and a kettlebell enthusiast. I spent years training with traditional weights until a herniated disc in 2023 forced me to rethink my entire approach to fitness. While I am absolutely not a doctor or a physical therapist, my own journey back to strength led me to discover the efficiency of kettlebell EMOMs.

As a solo developer working on weekends, I built Kettlebell EMOM to solve my own problem: I needed a structured, no-nonsense workout generator that fits into a 20-minute window between work and family life. I believe in owning your tools, which is why I’ve opted for a simple lifetime unlock instead of the typical subscription model.

When I'm not coding or swinging bells, I'm likely hanging out with my kids or defending the authenticity of my MRI scans on Reddit (and no, despite the rumors, it definitely wasn't a cat).
