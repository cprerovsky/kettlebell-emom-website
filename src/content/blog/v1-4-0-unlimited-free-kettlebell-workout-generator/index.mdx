When I launched v1.3.0, I thought the "3 Free Workouts" limit was a fair way to let people try the app. But after listening to the community and looking at the data, I realized I was building a "usage gate" instead of a "value bridge."

**v1.4.0 changes that. I’m stoping the counting and starting the training.**

## Unlimited Free Full Body Workouts
From today, the core of the app—the Full Body EMOM Generator—is **completely free with unlimited access.** I don't want you to worry about "wasting" a free trial session on a day when you only have 10 minutes. I want the Kettlebell EMOM Builder to be the tool you grab every time you see your kettlebell. No limits, no pressure, just structure.

**The Logic:** You get the signature "Heavy-Core-Finisher" flow for Full Body sessions forever. If you want to get specific with your training, that's where the Pro features come in.

## Precision Training: Targeted Muscle Splits
While Full Body is the foundation, serious progress often requires specificity. v1.4.0 introduces **Premium Targeted Splits**. 

You can now tell the generator to focus exclusively on:
* **Upper Body:** Push/Pull volume for a stronger frame.
* **Lower Body:** Explosive power and leg endurance.
* **Core-Focused:** Rotational strength and trunk stability.
* **Posterior Chain:** Mastering the hinge and strengthening your back and glutes.

This isn't just a filter; it's a recalibration of the generation logic to ensure your specialized sessions are as balanced and effective as the full-body ones.

## UI Overhaul: Built for Sweaty Thumbs
I’ve spent a lot of time refining the Generator interface. You’ll notice two big changes:
1.  **The Premium Zone:** A new visual distinction between Free and Pro features. It’s clear, honest, and stays out of your way once you’ve unlocked it.
2.  **Redesigned Steppers:** I’ve replaced the clunky input fields with a unified `[ - | value | + ]` control. It’s more space-efficient and much easier to use when your hands are shaking after a set of swings.

## A Fairer Way to Support the App
In my last post, I talked about my aversion for "Netflix-ing" fitness. That hasn't changed. 

With v1.4.0, I've moved the paywall from *quantity* to *quality*. 
* **Free users:** Get a world-class Full Body generator for life.
* **Pro users:** Unlock the ability to target muscle groups and future advanced programming logic.

You can still choose between a flexible monthly subscription or the **Lifetime Unlock**. Once you buy it, you own it—just like the iron in your gym.

**v1.4.0 is live on the App Store now. Go grab your bell and let’s work.**
