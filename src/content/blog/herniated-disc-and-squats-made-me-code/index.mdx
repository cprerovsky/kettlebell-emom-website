# From MRI to App Store: My Kettlebell Journey

This was my back in 2023. An MRI showed a herniated disc that felt like a death sentence for my training. I had been lifting for years, but suddenly, I was at an absolute low point. 

Standard physical therapy and "weird cow-cat workouts" did almost nothing for me. It wasn't until I found a trainer who stopped treating me like glass that things changed. We focused on hard work and barbell back squats. By late 2024, I was pain-free and hauling my own furniture again.

## The Problem with Traditional Training

While I had recovered, I found myself bored with the traditional "do a set, wait 2 minutes, repeat" rhythm of the gym. I discovered Kettlebells and loved the flow, but I desperately missed the structure my PT had given me. 

I needed a plan that:
1. Fit into a **20-minute window** without scrolling through YouTube or PDFs.
2. Provided balanced, challenging sessions every single time.
3. Allowed me to work out before the kids even noticed.

So, I did what any software developer would do: **I coded my own solution**.

## Introducing Kettlebell EMOM Builder

What started as a rough web-based MVP is now a fully polished iOS app designed for people who value their time and their health. 

### Why this app is different:
* **The "Heavy-Core-Finisher" Logic:** The generator creates balanced rounds in under 60 seconds to ensure you build strength and stability safely.
* **Built for Focus:** The UI features a massive timer and clear "up next" screens so you can put on your music and just work.
* **Safety First:** I've linked every exercise card to a YouTube search so you can verify your form instantly.
* **No Subscriptions:** I despise being "Netflix-ed" by every service. My app offers a simple **Lifetime Unlock** because I believe you should own your tools.

## Community FAQ

When I shared this on Reddit, the feedback was incredible. Here are some of the most common questions:

**"Can Kettlebells fix a herniated disc?"** Kettlebells didn't "fix" my disc—the body and time do that. But they helped me build a "muscular corset" to stabilize my spine after I was well on my way to recovery. *Always talk to a professional before starting a new program*.

**"Is there a beginner mode?"** Yes! The app is intended for beginner to intermediate levels. You can start with sessions as short as three exercises and very light weights.

**"Android version?"** I'm a solo developer working on weekends. If the iOS version gets enough traction to justify the extra dev time, bringing it to Android is definitely on my roadmap!

## Ready to Start?

I built this app because I needed it. I've been training with it 3-5 times a week for months, and it’s the most consistent I’ve ever been. Whether you’re recovering from an injury or just trying to stay fit between work and family, I’d love for you to give it a swing.
