When I first shared the **Kettlebell EMOM Builder** on Reddit, I was just a developer looking for a better way to train between work and family life. The response from the r/kettlebell community was a wake-up call. You didn't just want another timer; you wanted a tool that respects your time and your reality.

**v1.3.0 is the direct result of those conversations.**

## The Skip Button: Because Life Happens

One requested feature was simple: the ability to skip an exercise. 

Maybe your shoulder feels tight today, or maybe the kids just woke up early and you need to pivot. I'm not here to "shame" you into a workout you can't finish. I’m in the **structure business**, not the motivation business. 

<Callout>
**How it works:** Hit the "Skip" button on any exercise card. The EMOM timer adjusts instantly, and the generator keeps the rest of your session balanced. You keep training; the app handles the math.

## Lifetime Access: No More "Netflix-ing" Your Fitness

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I despise being "Netflix-ed" by every service I use. Adding another monthly charge to your credit card statement for a fitness app felt wrong to me.

For v1.3.0, I’ve officially launched **Lifetime Access**. 
* **Pay once, unlock forever.** 
* **No monthly "grind" of recurring fees.** 
* **Full access to all features and future updates.** 

This isn't about maximizing recurring revenue; it's about building a tool you can rely on for years.

## Why I Keep Building

Building this app alone was the scary part. Knowing that people are actually using it to stay consistent in their own "dad/dev/life" balance is what keeps me coding on weekends. 

If you're curious about the injury that started this whole obsession, you can **[read my full 2023 MRI story here](/blog/herniated-disc-and-squats-made-me-code)**.

Thanks for being part of this journey.

**v1.3.0 is live on the App Store.** 

*Train strong. Train consistent. Skip when you need to.*
