# Implementation Spec: kbemom.com Homepage Overhaul

## Section 1: Hero Section (The "Decision-Free" Hook)

**Goal:** Shift the value proposition from "speed" to "reducing mental load" for busy parents and professionals.

* **Headline:** "Stop Scrolling. Start Swinging."
* 
**Subheadline:** "A structured Kettlebell EMOM generator built by a software developer and dad who needed a plan that fits into a 20-minute window—no decision fatigue required."


* 
**Social Proof Bar (New):** Positioned below the main Call-to-Action: "Trusted by the r/kettlebell community with over 73,000 views."


* 
**Visual Strategy:** Hero image should feature the app's "Big Timer" and "Up Next" screens to emphasize clarity during high-intensity training.



---

## Section 2: The Philosophy (Polite "Anti-Subscription")

**Goal:** Address the community's frustration with recurring fees by positioning lifetime access as a core value.

* **Headline:** "You Own Your Kettlebells. You Should Own Your App."
* 
**Core Copy:** "I initially included a subscription because 'that’s what apps do,' but I personally despise being 'Netflix-ed' by every service."


* 
**Value Proposition:** "Kettlebell EMOM offers a simple lifetime unlock because you should focus on your training, not your monthly billing cycle."


* **Pricing Callout:** "One-time $29.99 purchase. Lifetime access. No subscriptions. Period."



---

## Section 3: The Story Hook (The "Why" - Trust Building)

**Goal:** Humanize the developer and build trust through a personal journey without making medical claims.

* **Placement:** Middle of the page, acting as a transition between features.
* 
**Visual:** High-contrast thumbnail of the 2023 MRI scan.


* **Headline:** "Built from a 2023 Injury."
* 
**Copy:** "A herniated disc at my absolute low point became the obsession behind this project. Once cleared to train, I needed a tool that prioritized structure and efficiency over ego."


* **CTA:** Link to the full blog post: *"Read the full story behind the app."*

## Section 4: The Workout Logic (Heavy-Core-Finisher)

**Goal:** Differentiate the app from random generators by explaining the specific programming logic.

* **Headline:** "Balanced Rounds, Not Random Reps."
* 
The Three-Stage Generator Logic:


* 
**Heavy:** Build foundational strength with targeted movements.


* 
**Core:** Transition to trunk stability and spinal support exercises.


* 
**Finisher:** Empty the tank with high-intensity movements to finish the session.




* 
**Benefit:** "Get a fully balanced session generated and ready to go in under 60 seconds."



---

## Section 5: Community-Driven Features

**Goal:** Showcase that the app is actively maintained and improved based on real lifter feedback.

* **Headline:** "Built for the Community, by a Solo Developer."
* **Key Features:**
* 
**The Skip Button:** "Added in version 1.3.0 because a user asked for a way to skip rest periods when they felt ready to move."


* 
**Form Support:** "Every exercise card links directly to instructions to help you verify your form instantly."


* 
**Focus-First UI:** "Big numbers and music support so you can see your progress from across the room."





---

## Section 6: Footer & Author Bio

**Goal:** Establish long-term SEO value and provide necessary legal disclaimers.

* **Blog Grid:** Display the three most recent Markdown posts to encourage indexing by search engines.
* 
**Author Bio:** "I am a developer, a dad, and a kettlebell enthusiast. And yes, despite the Reddit rumors, that MRI is definitely human—it's surprisingly hard to get a cat to sit still for a scan."


* **Mandatory Disclaimer:** "Kettlebell EMOM is a workout generator, not a medical device. I am not a doctor or a PT. Always consult a professional before starting a new exercise program."

### Implementation Note for AI Coder:

* Use **Astro components** for each section to ensure modularity.
* Ensure all images use **descriptive alt-text** (e.g., `alt="MRI scan showing herniated disc context"`).
* Maintain the **dark, high-contrast theme** to align with the app's visual identity.

Would you like me to generate the specific **Tailwind CSS/Astro code** for the "No Subscription" section next?
