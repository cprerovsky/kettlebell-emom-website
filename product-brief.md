# Product Brief: Kettlebell EMOM Builder
Web: [kbemom.com](https://kbemom.com)

## Elevator Pitch
Kettlebell EMOM Builder is the **fastest and simplest way** to create structured EMOM workouts with kettlebells. In less than one minute, users can generate a balanced training plan – tailored to selected muscle groups – and start immediately.

## Product Description
Kettlebell EMOM Builder is a mobile app (iPhone first, Android later) that helps beginner to intermediate kettlebell enthusiasts structure effective **Every Minute on the Minute (EMOM)** workouts.

The app comes with a **built-in exercise library** featuring the most popular beginner and intermediate kettlebell exercises. Each exercise is tagged with exactly one of five muscle groups:
- Full Body  
- Upper Body  
- Lower Body  
- Core  
- Posterior Chain  

Users choose their target muscle groups, number of exercises per round, and total number of rounds. A smart generator then builds a workout that:
- Covers all chosen groups evenly  
- Arranges exercises in a scientifically informed pattern for effectiveness and safety  
- Auto-generates a name (e.g. `"25 min Full Body + Upper Body"`)  

With a single tap on “Start Workout,” a countdown begins and the **EMOM Timer** takes over. During the workout, the app displays the current and next exercise, the round and exercise counters, and remaining workout time. After completion, the app shows a motivational message and a short workout summary.

## Target Audience
- Men and women aged **30+**, interested in structured kettlebell workouts.  
- Especially appealing to **busy professionals and midlifters (40–55 years)** who value efficiency and clarity.  
- Suitable for **beginners through intermediates** who don’t want to fuss with complex programming.

## Value Proposition
- **Speed**: Create a new workout in under 60 seconds.  
- **Clarity**: Logical exercise order, not random chaos.  
- **Structure**: Built-in timer, progress display, smooth flow.  
- **Motivation**: Auto-naming, countdowns, completion screen.  
- **Safety**: Focus on proven exercises with clear disclaimers (“not medical advice”).  

## Core Features (MVP)
- Exercise library with group tags.  
- Workout generator (select groups, exercises per round, rounds).  
- Auto-generated workout names.  
- EMOM timer (default 60s, ENV-configurable).  
- Display: current + next exercise, progress, remaining time.  
- Controls: pause/resume, exit with confirmation modal.  
- Completion screen with random motivational messages.  
- Modern, slick dark theme.  

## Out of Scope (MVP Backlog)
- Progression and tracking.  
- Audio cues and “3-2-1” countdown.  
- Double kettlebell mode.  
- Preset workouts.  
- Social or sharing features.  

## Positioning / Differentiation
- **Niche focus**: kettlebell + EMOM → little direct competition.  
- **Simple and functional**: not an “all-in-one fitness monster.”  
- Clear USP: **“From app start to workout in 60 seconds.”**
